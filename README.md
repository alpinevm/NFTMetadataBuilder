# Fives-Ballers
Mono-repo that contains all the necessary tooling to mint and maintain the Baller data and smart contracts.

### Install
```
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable @openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers dotenv
npm install @chainlink/contracts --save
```

### Test network:
Due to my excess of tokens, the `hardhat.config.js` is set to work with the Rinkeby test network by default. 

### Deployed Contracts:
FivesDNA v1 (Rinkeby): `0xc2BcaB2811330Ae3502b8465831221d70a701bed` <br>
